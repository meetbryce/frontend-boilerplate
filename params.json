{"name":"Frontend-boilerplate","tagline":"Everything I use to get a new project off the ground. Includes complete tooling using Gulp (SCSS, Autoprefixer, JS, img minification & auto refreshing wifi accessible server) and my go-to frameworks (BS3 + jQuery + Modernizr)","body":"# README\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n- HTML5 templated index.htm\r\n- Latest stable releases wired in (using Bower): Twitter Bootstrap 3, jQuery, Modernizr\r\n- Gulp setup with the following setup:\r\n    - SCSS compiling using libsass (including autoprefixer)\r\n    - Javascript minification and ready-to-enable concat\r\n    - Image optimisation using imagemin\r\n    - Auto-refreshing dev server using gulp-connect\r\n    - OS-level notification of errors & config so that the watcher continues running\r\n- Gitignore file setup for NodeJS, Python, and Webstorm\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n0. Check you have the required dependencies: Node ≥ v0.10 & npm ≥ 2.1.5 `node -v && npm -v`\r\n1. Clone the project `git clone https://github.com/meetbryce/frontend-boilerplate.git`\r\n2. Install NodeJS dependencies `npm install -d`\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n1. Compile files, start watching files, and start dev server `npm start`\r\n2. Open the dev server in your brower `localhost:8080` also available on the network using `ComputerName.local:8080`\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nmeetbryce/frontend-boilerplate is released under the MIT license.\r\n\r\n**Would love to know if you've found my repo useful via twitter - [@meetbryce](http://twitter.com/meetbryce)**\r\n\r\n\r\n## Recommended External Tools (work in progress)\r\n\r\n- [TotalTerminal](http://totalterminal.binaryage.com/) (free) - allows you to access your terminal with a shortcut\r\n- [TotalFinder](http://totalfinder.binaryage.com/) ($9) - allows you to access your finder with a shortcut, gives you a shortcut to reveal dotfiles, and have folders always appear at the top in list view\r\n- [ClipboardHistory](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/clipboard-history/id420939835?mt=12) ($4.99) - keeps a history of your clipboard with an easy to use interface and a shortcut for converting rich text to plain text\r\n- [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) (free beta) - used ST for 3 years or more and love it.\r\n- [Jetbrains Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) ($49) - fully-fledged IDE, I've only been using it for about a week but I'm really liking it already.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Future Plans\r\n\r\nBelow is a rough outline of things I want to integrate or consider integrating into this repo.\r\n\r\n- [x] `npm-shrinkwrap` rather than clunky `nvm`\r\n- [ ] ESLint/JSCS config file rather than just managing this in Webstorm \r\n- [ ] Browserify to better manage JS concatenation and dependencies. Would require removing Bower.\r\n- [ ] AngularJS, already have my boilerplate for this but still investigating ReactJS (mostly because Google isn't dogfooding Angular)\r\n- [ ] Testing framework\r\n- [ ] Support for [Alex](https://github.com/wooorm/alex) in the Gulp workflow\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
